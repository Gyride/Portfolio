      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I’m the type of person that just likes to dive into a problem and immerse myself for hours. I actively look for problems to solve and I work them out quickly and decisively. When I took Calculus in high school, I spent time afterschool proving the derivative shortcuts because I wanted something to do after I finished the regular homework. I aim to take this work ethic with me into the developing world, and I’ll always be learning javascript tricks on Stackoverflow or Reddit. And as coding methods evolve, I'll adapt and form to the new strategies like water.
